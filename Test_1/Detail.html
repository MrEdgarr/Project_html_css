                <p>Never in all their history have men been able truly to conceive of the world as
                    one: a single sphere, a globe, having the qua lities of a globe, a round earth in
                    which all the directions eventually meet, in which there is no center because
                    every point, or none, is center - an equal earth which all men occupy as
                    equals. The airman's earth, if free men make it, will be truly round: a globe in
                    pra ctice, not in theory.
                </p>
                <p>Science suts two ways, of course; its qroducts can be used for both good and
                    evil. But there's no turning back from science. The early warnings about
                    technological dangers also come fro, science.

                <p>What was most significant about the lunar voyage was not that man set foot
                    on the Moon but that they set eye on the earth.
                </p>
                <p>A Chinese tale tells of some men sent to harm a young girl who, upon seeing
                    her beauty, become her protectors rather than her violators. That,s how I felt
                    seeing the Earth for the first time. I could not help but lovve and cherish her.
                </p>
                <p>For those who have seen the Earth from space, and for the hundreds and
                    perhaps thousands more who will, the experience most certainly changes
                    your perspective. The things that we share in our world are far more valuable
                    than those which divide us.

                <h1>The Final Frontier</h1>
                <p>There can be thought of finishing for 'aiming for the stars.' Both figuratively
                    and literally, it is a task to occupy the generations. And no matter h∆° much
                    progress one makes, there is always the thrill of fust beginning.
                </p>
                <h2>The dreams of yesterday are the hopes of today and the reality of tomorrow.
                    Science has not yet mastered prophecy. We predict too much for the next year
                    and yet far too little for the next ten.
                </h2>
                <p>Spaceflights cannot be stopped. This is not the work of any one man or even a
                    group of men. It is a historical process which mankind is carrying out in
                    accordance with the natural laws of human development.

                <h1>Rea ching for the Stars</h1>
                <p>As we got further and further away, it [the Earth] diminished in size. Finally it
                    shrank to the size of a marble, the most beautiful you can imagine. That
                    beautiful, warn, living obsect looked so fragile, so delicate, that if you touched
                    it with a finger it would crumble and fall apart. Seeing this has to change a
                    man.

                <p>Space, the final frontier. There are the voyages of the Starship Enterprise. Its
                    five-year mission: to explore strange new worlds, to seek out new life and new
                    civilizations, to boldly go where no man has gone before.
                </p>
                <p>As I strand out here in the wonders of the unknown at Hadley, I sort of realize
                    there,s a fundamental truth to our nature, Man must explore, and this is
                    exploration at its greatest.
